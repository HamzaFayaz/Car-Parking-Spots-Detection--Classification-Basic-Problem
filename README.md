# Car Parking Spots Detection (Classification Problem Basic)


 ## Project Overview

This project aims to detect and classify car parking spots as either empty or not empty using video footage. The final system will work in real-time with a webcam.

## Real-Life Applications

- **Smart Parking Systems**: Help drivers find available parking spots quickly.
- **Traffic Management**: Optimize the use of parking spaces and reduce congestion.
- **Shopping Malls and Commercial Centers**: Provide real-time parking information to visitors.
- **Residential Complexes**: Manage parking spaces efficiently in large residential areas.
- **Airports and Train Stations**: Improve parking management in high-traffic areas.
- **Event Venues**: Streamline parking during events, reducing waiting times.

## Approach

### Data Collection

1. Capture video footage of the parking area with a stationary camera.
2. Annotate the video to label parking spots as 'empty' or 'not_empty'.

### Preprocessing

1. Convert video frames into images.
2. Apply binary masking to highlight parking spots.
3. Crop the images to focus on individual parking spots.

### Dataset Creation

1. Organize the cropped images into two categories: 'empty' and 'not_empty'.
2. Ensure a balanced dataset with enough samples for each category.

### Custom CNN Model

1. Design a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for binary classification.
2. Train the CNN on the prepared dataset.
3. Validate the model using a separate validation set.

### Model Optimization

1. Use data augmentation to make the model more robust.
2. Experiment with hyperparameters (learning rate, batch size, number of epochs) to improve performance.
3. Implement early stopping and model checkpointing to keep the best model.

### Integration with Webcam

1. Deploy the trained model to a system with a webcam.
2. Capture real-time video feed from the webcam.
3. Apply preprocessing steps (binary masking, cropping) to the video frames.
4. Use the trained model to classify each parking spot in the frame.

### Performance Enhancement

1. Monitor the modelâ€™s performance in real-time.
2. Collect feedback and retrain the model with new data regularly.
3. Optimize the system for low latency to ensure real-time detection.
