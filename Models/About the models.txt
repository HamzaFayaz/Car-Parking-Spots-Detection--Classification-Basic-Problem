Best.pt    ----> This model is trained on yolov8n and this model the most accurate model is all the three models
		 its test Accuray is approx 99.86% 
		 but this model have 99 layer which make them a larger model with repect to other and its 
		 Required a lot of cumputional power with repect to the Two


 
my_model.5   -----> This  Model is trained In tensorflow keras its a three layer model and its accuray in test data is approx 98.5%
		     is model is much simpler then the yolov8n 


model  ----->         This model is the simplest model is all of three its simple a classification model and also its accuray is good 
			I use this model is model to predict the data in this project but you can use what model you want




 Notes :   All the three models are trained and  use of diffrent FrameWork So the predict method is not same for all
